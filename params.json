{"name":"Time-lapse","tagline":"This + computer + webcam + Linuxish => time-lapse videos","body":"How I use this\r\n==============\r\nMe and my friend **dedicated** an Asus Eee **PC** to make **time-lapse videos** using an external HD **webcam**.\r\nThe computer is running the **GNU/Linux** distribution CrunchBang (based on Debian like Ubuntu).\r\n\r\nInstalling some software\r\n------------------------\r\n - **VLC** (to capture stills from the webcam)\r\n - **mencoder** (to make the stills into videos)\r\n - screen (optional, handy to keep track of the constantly running capturing process)\r\n - cheese (optional, good for testing webcam and tweaking its position and angle)\r\n\r\nAs CrunchBang comes with APT I can simply\r\n\r\n1. issue this in a terminal `sudo apt-get install vlc mencoder screen cheese`\r\n2. Now you might want to run `cheese` and try out your webcam, check it's resolution and what not.\r\n\r\nSetting up the scripts\r\n----------------------\r\n1. Then we'll get the scripts `git clone git@github.com:gorbiz/time-lapse.git`\r\n2. `cd time-lapse`\r\n3. You might want to edit the capturing script `nano start_capture`\r\n4. When all looks good start capturing `screen -S capturing ./start_capture`. XXX sometimes it breaks; try again :P. (Leave the screen by <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>a</kbd>, let go and hit <kbd>d</kbd>)\r\n\r\nPhotos should now stack up in the snaps/ folder. You can assemble all of them into a film clip using `render_full` or to include only today's `render_today`. However you'll probably want to **modify these scripts** to your liking.\r\n\r\nI like to automate all of that so I enter\r\n`crontab -e` and put something like this in there:\r\n```\r\n# Make a time-lapse video for today\r\n*/15 * * * * cd ~/time-lapse && ./render_today && cp ~/time-lapse/videos/today.avi ~/Dropbox/plant-lapse/\r\n\r\n# Make a time-lapse video from all photos (ever taken)\r\n0 0 * * * cd ~/time-lapse && ./render_full && cp ~/time-lapse/videos/full.avi ~/Dropbox/plant-lapse/\r\n\r\n# Put the latest snapshot in Dropbox\r\n* * * * * ls -t ~/time-lapse/snaps/*.png | head --lines=1 | xargs -i cp {} ~/Dropbox/plant-lapse/recent.png\r\n```\r\n\r\nRejoice!\r\n--------\r\n![time-lapse gif of our plants](http://gorbiz.github.io/time-lapse/images/plant-time-lapse.gif)\r\n\r\n<q>The earth has yielded its produce; God, our God, blesses us.</q> (Psalms 67:6)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
